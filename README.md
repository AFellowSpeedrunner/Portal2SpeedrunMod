# Portal 2 Speedrun Mod
Speedrun Mod for Portal 2. 
Skips majority of cutscenes and make dumb things slightly less dumb.

Features:
- Most of cutscenes were remade or completely removed to leave only gameplay parts;
- Dialogue is completely removed;
- Elevators are much faster;
- Majority of doors are opened faster or already opened;
- ...and many more improvements for your speedrunning experience;

Installation:
1. Download newest release archive from [releases tab](https://github.com/Krzyhau/Portal2SpeedrunMod/releases).
2. Unzip `Portal 2 Speedrun Mod` folder into `sourcemods` directory (its default location is `Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/`).
3. Restart Steam.
4. A new game, called "Portal 2 Speedrun Mod" should appear in your library.

Future of the mod:
I'm planning to make this mod a family fun box for whole speedrunning community, containing more than just one mode. After I'm happy with Cutsceneless Mode, I want to create:
- fog% (complete the game with really dense fog)
- 100 Portals Run (complete the game in 100 portals)
- 100% Run (complete the game with all achievements)
- Randomized Map Order (well... yes)
- Fat Run (complete the game while being 1,875x larger)
- Potato Challenge (A copy of SMO's Baloon World)
- Celeste% (idk, people force me to do it to meme msushi)
- ...and many more
